To include other files like images and code snippets into your site, you may either:

1. Place the images in `./pages/path/to/resource` and it will be copied to the corresponding location in `./public/path/to/resource` (good for figures and illustrations).

2. Place the images in `./themes/path/to/resource` and it will be copied to the corresponding location in `./themes/path/to/resource` (good for client-side js and header images).

For example, this image was placed in `./pages/how-to-include-files/turtle.png`:

![](/how-to-include-other-files/turtle.png)
